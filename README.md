Hi Everyone!

This is our First Project with Vanilla JavaScript.

Our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (London, GB).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
